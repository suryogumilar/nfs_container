## from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/466999/what-does-exec-do
##The "$@" bit will expand to the list of positional parameters (usually the command line arguments), individually quoted to avoid word splitting and filename generation ("globbing").

##The exec will replace the current process with the process resulting from executing its argument.

##In short, exec "$@" will run the command given by the command line parameters in such a way that the current process is replaced by it (if the exec is able to execute the command at all).

#exec "$@"

#echo "args: $@"

if [ -z "$@" ]
then
    ## Run forever
    sleep infinity    
else
    echo "execute $@"
    exec "$@"
fi
